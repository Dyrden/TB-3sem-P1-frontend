Team Beaver
=================
### Group
We are Team Beaver and our group consists of 4 members
- Bj√∏rn Hastrup
- Ferhat Baran
- Kristian Wede
- Mark Denner

### Planning
We plan to meet Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. Wednesday and Friday will be an online meeting.
We will meet in KEA and use their facility, and meet online from our homes if our meeting is online.

### Meets
To ensure everyone has attended our meeting we will take protocol and write down the names of those who don't  show up or meet up late.
Everyone has to write their reason for not showing up, if they have one.

If a member from the group does not announce why he is absent, we will will try contacting him. If we cannot get in touch with the member we will wait a day. If the member still does not respond we will contact our teacher after decision-making in our group.

### Branching strategy
We have chosen the branching strategy:
- Story/task branching strategy
We are doing this because we want to split the different stories features of our system. This will make sure everyone gets to play with the backend & frontend.
